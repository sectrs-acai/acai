** gdev
In order to run the gpu on the fvp we need:
- a kernel stub for nouveau which exposes the same char drm device
- libdrm, libucuda and libgdev compiled for aarch64
  - libdrm is part of buildroot build, dynamically loaded during execution
  - we have to build libucuda and libgdev
- the benchmark itself
  - contains of c code and cudabin
    - c code: needs aarch64 cross compiler
    - cuda bin needs cuda 8 nvcc with fermi support (sm20), which itself needs gcc 4.8
