* Gdev builds
We support gdev in cuda driver API version as well as runtime API version.

For this we use the following conventions:
- Build gdev shared library and install in =/usr/local/gdev=
- Build cuda shared library with driver api support to =/usr/local/gdev_cuda/=
- Build cuda shared library with runtime api support to =/usr/local/gdev_cudart/=

During benchmark execution, add =/usr/local/gdev/lib64= as well as either
=/usr/local/gdev_cudart/lib64= or =/usr/local/gdev_cuda/lib64= to
LD_LIBRARY_PATH
